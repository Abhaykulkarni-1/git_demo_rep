# 🦠 COVID-19 Analysis and Visualization using Plotly Express

This project visualizes the global impact of COVID-19 using **Python**, **Plotly Express**, and **Pandas**.  
It explores patterns in confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and testing rates across countries through rich, interactive visualizations.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic generated massive datasets that reveal how different regions responded and recovered.  
This project leverages **data visualization** to transform those raw numbers into insights — showing trends, hotspots, and testing efficiency using **interactive charts**.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📊 Interactive bar charts for total cases, deaths, and recoveries  
- 🌍 Country-wise and continent-wise breakdowns  
- 🎨 Custom color scales and hover interactions for better readability  
- 📈 Scatter plots to compare testing density vs. total cases  
- 🗂 Real-time-like overview of the top affected regions  
- ⚙️ Easily extendable for future datasets or metrics (like vaccination data)

## 📊 Visualizations

Some key visualizations in this project include:

- **Top 15 Countries by Total Cases**
- **Scatter plot of Tests per Million vs. Total Cases**
- **Continent-wise Comparisons**
- **Bar Charts for Deaths and Recoveries**
- **NDVI-style colorscale for data highlighting**

## 🧾 Example Code Snippet

```python
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('covid_data.csv')

# Top 15 countries by total cases
fig = px.bar(dataset.head(15),
             x='Country/Region',
             y='TotalCases',
             color='TotalCases',
             title='Top 15 Countries by Total COVID-19 Cases')

fig.show()
